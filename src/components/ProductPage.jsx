		    	<p> The common {this.props.name} and its allies, are important for their attractive timber,
which is hard, dense, tight-grained and polishes to a very smooth finish. The colour ranges from creamy white
in the sapwood to a dark chocolate colour in the heartwood. When kiln-dried, {this.props.name} tends toward a dull
brown colour, but when air-dried can become a rich purplish-brown. Because of its colour, hardness and grain,
it is a prized furniture and carving wood.</p>
